# ðŸ¤–ðŸ’¬ AI Assistant Python Template
This is a production-ready Python template that can be used to ship agentic systems with FastAPI
and LangGraph. The template aims to provide a boilerplate solution with batteries included, 
including:
- API (FastAPI)
- AI Agents (LangGraph, Tools)
- User Interface (assistant-ui)
- Monitoring & Observability (Grafana, LangFuse)
- Model Evaluations (LangFuse)
- CI/CD (GitHub Actions)


## ðŸŒŸ Features


> **_Note:_**  The default model used in the boilerplate code is set to Google Gemini on Vertex AI,
> however, the code structure lets you choose the language model of your preference with minimal 
> changes required, due to the abstractions put in place.
